MS: Why do you code?

P: As a part of my Astronomy studies, I attended classes on essentials of programming in Python and C language. I noticed in myself qualifications to be a programmer. I have continued my learning and signed up for computer science subjects: C++ language and Programming Methods. I paid attention to create simple two-dimensional games which gave me joy. They allowed me to better understand and use my knowledge of programming. I am well acquainted with object oriented programming and pointers. Returning to unfinished projects showed me which parts of the code were illegible and incomprehensible. I have learned to write comments and to name variables, classes or functions in order to leave tips for understanding the code and to make it easier to continue the project after a long break. Programming has taught me to pay attention to details and to be patient - these abilities affect my whole life and make it better. I believe that through the development of programming, I develop myself.
